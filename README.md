If my office hours don't work for you, just contact me to and we'll see if we can't work out a time that works for everyone.

## What should I do if I miss a workshop?

Not to worry! All the materials used in the workshop (Including the starting and ending state of whatever we worked on) are neatly organized in the folders in this repo. The READMEs in each folder will briefly describe what we did during the workshop so you can get a grasp of what was covered. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact Jesse with the links above or by going to their office hours.
