# Coffee Challenge!

## Objective

Be the one of the first two people to complete the task below and I will buy you a Starbucks drink of your choosing.
 
## Task

Here's what you've got to do:

* Populate the forecastDayLabels, forecastTemperatureLabels, and forecastDescriptionLabels with appropriate data
* Get the labels on top to show the appropriate location/day and time.
 
### Hints

* forecastDayLabels, forecastTemperatureLabels, and forecastDescriptionsLabels are not normal IBOutlets. They are each IBOutletCollections. Use what you know about iterating through arrays to your advantage.
* Look at MapKit. Specifically CLGeocoder. Even more specifically the reverseGeocodeLocation method. Look, just check out this Stack Overflow answer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27735835/convert-coordinates-to-city-name
 
## Bonus

If you can implement a ~~good~~ decent temperature to color algorithm to affect the color of the temperatures in the labels, you will win an exclusive VIP super-prize.
 
## How to submit

When you think you've got it just send a zip file of the project through Facebook to jessetipton@icloud.com
